## Purpose
This project was created as a demonstration of the VR capabilities that Unity has to offer. The assets used in the project were imported into Unity, and using Unity's XR packages, a VR version of a modeled dining room was developed.

This project was shown to IMM 360: Games 1 as a part of the IMM 391 (Games 1 Learning Assistant) curriculum.

## Project Description
In the VR version of The Dining Room, users are able to view individually created assets and immerse themselves in a nostalgic environment. Players are able to walk around through teleportation, and they are able to pick up plates or move chairs and toss them to their desired locations.
